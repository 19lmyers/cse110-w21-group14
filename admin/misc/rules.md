## 2. Primary Means of Communication and Expectations
Our group's primary method of communication is Slack. 

We encourage members to turn on their notifications and react or respond promptly to messages so our group stays in-sync and everyone knows what is going on.
If that is not possible, members are expected to check Slack at least once a day at minimum.

## 3. Scheduling Meetings
Before every meeting, one team member will prepare an agenda (usually based on assignments due).

Every Sunday morning, the team leads will send out a When2Meet on Slack to determine the best meeting times for that week. 
Team members are expected to fill it out accurately and comprehensively.

If someone misses a meeting, they are expected to ask questions and look at the meeting minutes to ensure they are caught up.

## 4. General Responsibilities for All Team Members
Team members are expected to:
- Treat their fellow team members with respect
- Ask questions and stay on top of things
- COMMUNICATE and keep each other updated
- Follow through with assigned duties, or reach out for help

In addition, team members will be expected to record meeting minutes on a rotating basis.

## 5. Conflict Resolution
To resolve any conflicts that may arise, team members should speak with each other and attempt to work out a resolution, as a group if necessary. 
Conflicts can and will happen, so team members need to be willing to listen to each other.

If a resolution cannot be reached for a major decision, we will come to a decision via majority vote. 
Ties will be settled by the team leads, and if necessary, the TA.

## 6. Expectations of Faculty and TA's
If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the staff, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.
