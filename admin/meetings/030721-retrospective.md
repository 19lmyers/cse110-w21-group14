**Results: (Average)**
- Engagement: 3.9

**Notes**    
Overall, we have a pretty good engagement with the tasks to be completed. Mastery was pretty low because teammates felt that they could not complete certain tasks on their own. Teammates also feel that they had more impact during this sprint.

### Retro    
Choose Retro - Mad, Sad, Glad:

**Notes**    
* Common ideas for being glad was that we felt pretty accomplished this sprint and are proud of our team. Some commonality in terms of what made the team sad and mad was some felt they wish they learned more or could contribute more, but felt there was too little time to learn. Something new that was brought up was feeling burnt out and getting compared to other groups.
* A couple people felt they were slacking in terms of their contribution to the team.

### Action Plan    
- Plan to complete all testing, refactoring, and documentation done by this week. We also plan to start working on our presentation.    
- Reach out to teammates if they ever need help or just to even check in (be supportive).
