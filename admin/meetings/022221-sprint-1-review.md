## Agenda and Meeting Notes
### Sprint 1 Review
1. Review the Sprint's Results.
   > Review product backlog. Check what was completed and explain any that weren't.
What was completed:
  - Established first phase styling and commenting guidelines   
  - Updating event modeling diagram
  - Implementing timer functionality
  - Created HTML File
  - Basic CSS Styling
  - Settings Functionality
  - Prototype Implementation: Progress Bar functionality 
  - Prototype Implementation: session tracking and reset button   
What wasn't and why:
  - Confirmation Card was not done because our other tasks took longer than we thought, and many people in our team had midterms this week.

2. Discuss and demonstrate the work.   
**Developers**      
- Successes:  
- Finished up core prototype functionality.  
- Increment pomodoros - resetted the pomodoros therefore the website is able to keep track of the amount of pomodoros a person completed and will also be able to reset if they click the reset button.  
- Timer functionality.  
- Implemented settings menu.  
  - Finished progress bar and sessions tracking JavaScript.  
- Pain points:  
- At the start was how to organize all the parts to that everything was nicely decomposed.   
- How to organize all the parts to that everything was nicely decomposed .CSS Styling, but we are planning on finishing up styling next week.   
- Everyone was especially swamped with midterms this week, most people weren't free until the weekends.   
- Our entire team is fairly new to JavaScript and CSS, so there was quite a steep learning curve.   
 
**Testers**   
Successes: 
- Setting up the basic task for the timer. 
  - Testing the timer functionality
Pain points: 
  - Being sink with thw developers
**Pipeline Managers**
Successes:    
- There was no issues with merging. Tracking everyone's separate branches was good.   
 
Pain points:   
   - Still having build errors with ESlint.    



3. Current status of the project
Demo project: 

   We think our current status of the project is in a good place. We have the timer functionality working as it should, and got our settings option all set up.
Thoughts?

   We believe we are on the right track in terms of timing and finishing the project. We need to focus on CSS and the confirmation screen, but we believe we can get majority of it done by the end of this week.

4. Future plans for next sprint
- CSS Styling
- Confirmation Screen popup

### New Business
Continue to retrospective.
