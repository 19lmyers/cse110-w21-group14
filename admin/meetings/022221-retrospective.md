## Agenda and Meeting Notes

### Work Happiness Radar
Team rates how happy they are.
**Results (Averages):**
- Clarity: 3.7   
- Autonomy 3.7      
- Mastery 3.3     
- Meaning 4.3         
- Impact 3.6      
- Engagement 4.3         

**Notes**   
Overall, we were surprised that Mastery was low, but it was mainly because we feel that we are still learning as we work, so we do not feel completely mastered.

### Retro
Mad, Sad, Glad:
**Common Ideas:**
1. Mad: We found out sort of last minute that we should have some type of way to track the task during a pomo cycle.   
2. Sad: Code uniformity is lacking and need to get a lot of CSS work done.    
3. Glad: Our team is good with stepping up and communicating. We are glad we completed the last sprint as well.

### Action Plan
- Developers will meet to have a code refactory and ES Lint meeting so that it is more clear and concise. 
- Thorough code review in week 10
