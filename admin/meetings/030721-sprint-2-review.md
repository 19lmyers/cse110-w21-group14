## Agenda and Meeting Notes
### Sprint 1 Review
1. Review the Sprint's Results.
   > Review product backlog. Check what was completed and explain any that weren't.
- What was completed:
  - Implementation of sounds
  - Writing unit tests for confirmation cards, settings page, progress bar, and timer functionality
  - Fixed Progress Bar
  - Fixed Pipeline
  - Implemented local storage functionality
  - Implemented confirmation windows and page warning confirmation
- What wasn't and why:
  - Confirmation screen for the task list because we implemented the task list a bit late into our sprint
  - CSS styling because we still had one minor thing to fix (otherwise mostly done)
  - Document Code because we needed to work out other implementation kinks before going into this
  - Integration testing because needed to complete unit tests first

2. Discuss and demonstrate the work.

3. Current status of the project

- Thoughts?
 - We are happy with our work this sprint because we got 95% of our implementation done. We just have minor CSS Styling to do and finishing up our task list.

4. Future plans for next sprint
- We plan to full complete implementation by tomorrow and will focus on refactoring our code, finalizing testing, documentation, and creating our presentation.
