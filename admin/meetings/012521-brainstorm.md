## Agenda and Meeting Notes
### ***Special thanks to Jackson for editing our team video!***

- Announcements: CSE 110 discussion is now mandatory (repurcussions of not attending are unknown yet), no grading rubrics
- Briefly go over what we brainstormed last time
- Continue with Miro brainstorm ideas
- Create a timeline and what we want to complete by next week

### Group Assignments
**Brainstorming Assignment**   
Narrow down the problem we're solving and what features a system would need to address it.
- Clarify definitions and requirements
- Think about users and their expectations
- Decide on app theme or mood
- Survey competition

Tasks:   
1. Capture documents and diagrams to upload in Github `/specs/brainstorm/` folder.
2. Summarize brainstorming notes:

***Notes*** 
- Gary, Justin, and Jackson will work on designing an initial realistic prototype
- We want to implement just the timer with the start & end buttons
 - What to complete:
  - Timer buttons
  - Actual timer (25 min work, 5 min break) that works with set time
  - Pomodoro title name and begin button
- Then we will move onto the logging activity

Project Pitch:
 - Problem: The general population tends to struggle focusing on their tasks for the day. There are so many distractions these days such as notifications going off on technological devices. There must be a way to effectively get work done within a specific amount of time.
 - Appetite: We plan to work on this for the next 6.5 weeks. Since this is not that much time relative to the other various tasks we as students need to complete, we know that this constrains our solution to strictly first focus on the core elements of a Pomodoro timer.
 - Solution: The core elements that we want to include is setting the timer, making sure the time works as it should, etc. 
 - Rabbit Holes: Logging activity might be more complicated, so we need to determine whether or not it is completely required or what the simplest way to initially implement it is. Something we need to also keep in mind with each task / pomodoro is if it will give the proper breaks (the cycle needs to be tracked).
 - No-gos: The purpose of this project is not supposed to be a to do list so we don't want to focus all of our work on that aspect. We also will not do an hourglass because that is a more time consuming implementation.

- Homework for everyone **Due: Saturday, January 30th** :
 - Jackson, Justin, and Gary: Working on prototype
 - Everyone else: write short list of final implementation ideas, create 1 persona and upload to github


### New Business
- Discussion Section Announcement
- Overarching decisions

### Agenda for Next Week/Meeting
- Finalize prototype -- make more ADRs for it
- Discuss log activity where users can fill out their activities and how many pomodoros it may take them
