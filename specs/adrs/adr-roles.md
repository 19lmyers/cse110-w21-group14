# Assigning Roles

* Status: Accepted
* Deciders: Harshi and Luke
* Date: 2021-02-06

## Context and Problem Statement

After making decisions on the design of the timer and its functionality, we needed to start assigning roles so that everyone can contribute equally to the project.

## Decision Drivers

* Need developers and testers
* Need to manage pipeline and GitHub repo 
* Don't need everyone to design and develop project

## Considered Options

* All developers, volunteer testers and repo manager
* Pairs, half developers and half testers
* 3 developers, 3 testers, 3 managers with pair teams

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Option 3, because
* It would be easier to create a 3-person team of developer, tester, and a repo manager to handle merging issues.
* Doesn't require multiple meetings for all team members.
