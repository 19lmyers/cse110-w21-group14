## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[option 1]", because [justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force force | … | comes out best (see below)].

>
> * Implicit assumptions should be made explicit.
>  Design documentation is important to enable people understanding the decisions later on.
>  See also [A rational design process: How and why to fake it](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.1986.6312940).
> * The MADR format is lean and fits our development style.
> * The MADR structure is comprehensible and facilitates usage & maintenance.
> * The MADR project is vivid.
