# Timer Design

* Status: Accepted
* Date: 2021-01-31

## Context and Problem Statement

We want the timer to have a design reflecting our group's values of respect, peace, optimism, honesty, and focus.
We considered a few sets of fonts, color schemes, and timer designs to find a set that reflected our dedication to the outside world of nature.

## Considered Options

(Pictures are available on Miro.)

Fonts:
* Montserrat
* Poppins
* Source Code Pro
* Lato
* Roboto
* Open Sans

Color schemes:
* Gary's color scheme
* Olipop-inspired
* TailwindCSS colors
* Teal mountains

Background colors:
* Solid color
* White
* Gradient
* Image (simple)
* Image (realistic)

Timer designs:
* Hourglass
* Stopwatch
* Minimalistic
* Gary's timer

## Decision Outcome

We chose the following:
* Montserrat + Source Code Pro
* Teal mountains color scheme
* Solid color background
* Gary's timer

We feel these selections best reflect our group values, while being relatively easy to implement compared to the other options.
