## About Luna and Her Needs: 
Before the pandemic, she worked in an office for her employer.
During the pandemic, she is working less hours and from home.
So she decided to get her Master's degree in CS from an online college.
Working from home has many temptations including: Playing on her phone, social media, and watching TV. This has caused her production to drop. 
She wants to keep all work to 8 hours a day to be able to take care of her family. 
She needs something to help her manage working time, school time, and break time.
