## About
Mia is a self-taught, freelance programmer. She doesn't like working at home and prefers to work
in semi-crowded areas such as coffee shops in the afternoon or bars in the morning. She gets 
frequently distracted by other people. She doesn't like trying new things, so she'd be apprehensive
about trying a pomodoro timer application. She is a minimalist who like straight lines and light
colors.
