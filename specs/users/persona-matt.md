## About
Matt is supermarket owner. He realized he isn't happy in his current career. He chose this path because he had to provide for his family. After his wife passed away and his kids are grown up and with families of their own, he decided to go back to school. He chose an online college because of his age. Since he has to continue working to afford tuition, he has to find a work-school balance. He doesn't like trying new things but he needs a way to keep up with his college courses.
